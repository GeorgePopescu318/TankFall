# TankFall
## Project Overview

### Game Concept
Immerse yourself in the thrill of a 2D shooter game where you play the sole defender of the planet. Face relentless enemies aiming to destroy the planet, and accumulate points by skillfully shooting them down. The game leverages an Arduino Uno, an 8x8 LED matrix, and an LCD display for an engaging experience.

## Development Process

### Inspiration

The inspiration of the game was a game I used to play as a child, Tank Wars, it is a 2D platformer game where you are a tank and you shoot your enemies into oblivion.

### Game Logic
Crafted to deliver dynamic gameplay, the game features strategic enemy movements and rewards precise shooting with points. Collision detection ensures accurate scoring.

### LCD Menu Integration
An intuitive LCD menu system allows players to customize their experience. Adjust the brightness of the 8x8 LED matrix and LCD display, and turn on or off the game's sounds.

## How to Play

1. **Power On:**
   - Start the game by powering up the Arduino Uno.

2. **LCD Menu Navigation:**
   - Use the designated controls to navigate through the LCD menu.
